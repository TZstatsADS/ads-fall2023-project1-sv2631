### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: What makes people happy?
+ This project is conducted by Shreya Verma

+ Project summary:  This report is inspired by a conversation between my grandmother and I. It aims at finding out the what makes people of different age groups and marital statuses happy. Before beginning the analysis, I started with cleaning and processing the original data 'cleaned_hm.csv' to make it ready for analysis. I applied techniques such as lower casing letters, removing punctuations and extra spaces, stemming the words, and making id for each happy moment. This final data  'processed_moments.csv' is stored in the output folder. Then I combined this processed text with the demographic data 'demographic.csv' and selected a subset of the combined data satisfying specific row conditions.

Following [suggestions](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) by [RICH FITZJOHN](http://nicercode.github.io/about/#Team) (@richfitz). This folder is orgarnized as follows.
